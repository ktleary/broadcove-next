  - title: "Who We Are"
    content: "Broadcove is an independent software engineering consultancy founded by Kevin Leary in 2019. With over two decades of experience building web and mobile applications, Kevin works directly with clients — no account managers, no layers of abstraction. You get a senior engineer from day one. Based in the Greater Boston area and working remotely with teams worldwide."
  - title: "Background"
    content: "Before Broadcove, Kevin spent years as a senior developer at startups and enterprises across the US and internationally. From 2016 to 2023, he worked remotely from cities across Europe, Africa, South America, and Southeast Asia — shipping production code from Lisbon, Cape Town, Buenos Aires, Berlin, and beyond. That experience built a deep appreciation for async communication, clear documentation, and self-directed execution."
  - title: "What We Do Best"
    content: "Full-stack JavaScript and TypeScript (React, Node.js, Next.js), Python backends, cloud infrastructure, and practical AI integration. We specialize in taking products from zero-to-one and from prototype-to-scale. Recent work includes AI-powered features, LLM integrations, agentic systems, and modernizing legacy codebases for companies that need to move faster."
  - title: "How We Work"
    content: "Small engagements, high impact. We prefer to go deep with a few clients rather than spread thin across many. Typical engagements range from building MVPs for early-stage startups to augmenting engineering teams at established companies that need senior-level help on critical projects. We communicate clearly, ship frequently, and write code that the next developer will thank us for."
  - title: "Get in Touch"
    content: "If you have a project that needs experienced hands, reach out at hello@broadcove.io. We're always happy to chat — even if it's just to help you think through a technical decision."
