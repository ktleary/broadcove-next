  - title: Architecture & Development
    anchor: architecture
    content: We build web and mobile applications on a modern TypeScript stack — React, Node.js, Next.js, and Python on the backend. Every project starts with architecture that fits the actual requirements, not a one-size-fits-all template. We design for the scale you need today while making it straightforward to grow tomorrow. Cloud deployment on AWS, DigitalOcean, or your preferred platform is included — not an afterthought.

  - title: AI Integration
    anchor: ai
    content: Practical AI that solves real problems. We integrate LLMs, build agentic workflows, and add intelligent features to existing products — document processing, natural language interfaces, automated decision-making, and more. We focus on reliability and production-readiness, not impressive demos that break under real usage. If you're exploring how AI can improve your product or operations, we can help you figure out what's worth building and what's hype.

  - title: Performance & Modernization
    anchor: performance
    content: Slow sites lose users. Legacy code slows down teams. We optimize existing applications for speed and maintainability — identifying bottlenecks, modernizing outdated stacks, migrating to TypeScript, improving test coverage, and setting up CI/CD pipelines. The goal is a codebase your team can move fast in, not just one that works today.

  - title: API Design & Integration
    anchor: scalability
    content: Clean, well-documented APIs are the backbone of any modern application. We design and build RESTful and GraphQL services, handle third-party integrations, and architect systems that are reliable under load. Whether you need a public API for partners, internal services for your team, or integrations with payment processors, CRMs, or data providers — we've done it.

  - title: Technical Consulting
    anchor: consulting
    content: Sometimes you don't need another developer — you need someone who's been through it before. We advise founders and engineering leads on stack selection, build-vs-buy decisions, hiring technical talent, preparing for scale, and navigating the rapidly evolving AI landscape. Practical guidance from two decades of building software, not theoretical frameworks.
