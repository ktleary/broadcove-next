The market's AI narrative has been dominated by semiconductors, hyperscalers, and infrastructure plays for the past three years. But a shift is underway. The next phase of the AI trade — sometimes called "AI Productivity" — focuses on the non-tech companies that are integrating AI into their existing business models to cut costs, increase margins, and operate more efficiently.

Think banks automating compliance workflows, insurers using LLMs for claims processing, retailers deploying agentic shopping experiences, and logistics companies optimizing routes with machine learning. These companies benefit from AI without the massive capital expenditure burden that's compressing free cash flow at the mega-caps.

The thesis is straightforward: if you believe AI is going to be genuinely useful, the biggest winners over the next decade won't be the companies selling the shovels — they'll be the ones using them.
